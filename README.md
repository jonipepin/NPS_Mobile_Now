* Having a hard time remembering to muster by 1000? Schedule a daily confirmation check! Unlike traditional alarms, the Muster Reminder feature will only alert you if you have not mustered. If you've mustered for the day, it leaves you alone. And, it's already programmed to skip weekends and holidays (including official 72's and 96's).

How It Works:
- Muster is verified one of two ways: if your device is connected to the NPS wifi network, the app goes to the student check-in page and checks for a successful confirmation message; if not on the NPS wifi network, the app checks your email folders for your muster confirmation email (changing the app setting to check a specific email folder makes this process much faster!).
- When you schedule a recurring muster verification, the app is programmed to automatically skip weekends and published holidays, so you won't be bothered on your day off. 
- Enabling the Snooze feature means that you will continue to receive reminder notifications at interval of your choice until the app detects that you have successfully mustered.
- Lunch specials are checked daily M-F, and are available as soon as the Cafe Del Monte staff posts the day's menu (usually around 0800, but NLT 0900). Refresh the Lunch card by tapping the icon in the top left corner.
- Events are retrieved from both the NPS website and the MWR website and ordered chronologically. The two next upcoming events from each category are displayed on the Events card.
